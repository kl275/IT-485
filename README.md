# IT-485
# Introduction

This code was created as the final project for NIT special topics class IT-485 Applications of AI in games.
Assignment was to develop a specialized AI program based on topics covered in the course, and apply
the knowledge to something new. For the project, I decided implement a pathfinding algorithm to the game
"Letters from Whitechapel" by Fantasy Flight Games.
